This repository contains the implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for modeling one-dimensional transient heat conduction in layered soil, as part of a Research Project thesis in Robotic Systems Engineering at RWTH Aachen University.

The study focuses on simulating heat transfer in Ground Source Heat Exchangers (GSHEs) integrated with Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in urban environments. The model incorporates moisture-dependent thermal properties and validates predictions against experimental field data from Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.

Key Features:

- Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) implementation for 1D heat conduction with internal heating

- Empirical coupling of thermal properties (diffusivity, heat capacity) to soil moisture

- Layered soil modeling with piecewise material properties

- Validation against real-world field data from a geothermal test site

- Mesh-free, data-efficient simulation approach using PyTorch
